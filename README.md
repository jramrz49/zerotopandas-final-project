# zerotopandas-final-project

This was part of a six week program from Jovain. It was a program to learn Python, Pandas, matplotlib, and numpy which are the nessceray skills to necessary for Data Analysis. my final project was to perform data analysis on any dataset of my choosing using the skills we learn in the six week program. I choose to look at the NBA 2020 season(does not include the playoffs nor the finals) to answer questions I had about the data set. The final project will showcase my skills in Data Analysis.
